# Coding Standards

- Never use `unwrap()` or `expect()`
- Always propagate errors with `?` or handle them explicitly using `match` / `if let`

# Architecture

- **Workspace members**: `src/engine`, `src/app`, `cli/addon`
  - `evotengine` (src/engine) — agent runtime: provider abstraction, agent loop, context, tools, retry
  - `evot` (src/app) — application layer: session, storage, config, server, commands, skills, delivery, search
  - `evotaddon` (cli/addon) — Rust NAPI addon bridging engine/app to the TypeScript CLI
- **CLI**: TypeScript (Bun) in `cli/src/`, renders TUI, handles input, sessions, updates
- `mod.rs` / `lib.rs`: only module declarations, re-exports, and `use` statements — no business logic

# Testing

- All tests go in the crate's `tests/` directory, never inline
- Rust targeted tests: `cargo test -p <crate> <test-name>` or the narrowest relevant `cargo test` command
- TS targeted tests: `cd cli && bun test <test-file>` for the changed area
- Run full `cargo test` or full `cd cli && bun test` only when changes are broad or cross-cutting
- Keep tests explicit and fast; focus on core logic
- A change to one workspace crate can break another: before committing Rust changes, run the full suite once — `make test-rust` (or `make check`, which includes it)

# Schema Compatibility

Files under `~/.evotai`, remote API DTOs, addon JSON, and stored sessions are published contracts.

- Never remove or rename a published field directly. Keep deprecated wire/cache fields serialized even after domain logic stops using them.
- Every added field must be backward-readable via `#[serde(default)]`, `Option<T>`, or an explicit migration.
- Do not change a published field's type or meaning in place; add a new field and migrate.
- Persistent formats need a schema version independent of server/catalog versions. Missing versions must map to legacy v0; reject unsupported future versions clearly.
- Keep compatibility fields out of business decisions. Wire/persistent DTOs may retain fields that domain logic ignores.
- Treat custom provider entries in `~/.evotai/evot.env` as user data. Cloud login/reconcile and settings rewrites must preserve their selection, secrets, URLs, models, protocols, capability fields, and non-evot preamble lines.
- Every schema change requires historical fixtures and both directions of contract testing: old data → current reader, and current writer → strict legacy reader.
- Persistent state writes must use a same-directory temporary file, flush/sync, and atomic rename; never truncate the live JSON file in place.

# Pre-commit

- Before committing, run the relevant targeted tests for the files changed
- Run `make check` before committing only when Rust code, shared build config, or cross-workspace behavior changed
