 * `send-prefix` forwards as a literal 0x02, so the binding does work there --
 * only the advertised spelling was wrong, which is worse than no hint at all: a
 * user who presses once sees nothing happen and concludes the feature is broken.
 *
 * Assumes tmux's default prefix, the same assumption Claude Code makes. A user
 * who rebound the prefix has already made ctrl+b arrive directly, so the plain
 * spelling would be the correct one and this hint overstates it. Harmless in
 * that direction: pressing twice still backgrounds, once.
