/**
 * The load-bearing claim behind the timed reveal: rewriting a committed line
 * genuinely takes the secret off the terminal.
 *
 * Everything else about the feature is pure logic and tested as such. This is
 * the part that depends on renderer behavior, so it is asserted against a real
 * terminal emulator: the frame is rebuilt from `compactLines` each cycle, so the
 * masked text replaces the revealed row rather than being appended below it.
 *
 * The second case is the one worth having. A reveal that has scrolled out of the
 * visible window is no longer reachable by a differential patch, and a patch
 * that silently skipped it would leave the credential in the terminal's own
 * scrollback — erased on screen in principle, still there when you scroll up.
